# IPL Score Prediction 
The IPL(Indian Premier League) Score Prediction Project aims to develop a data-driven methodology to predict the results of  matches using historical data and machine learning to provide insights to fans and participants during the IPL and predict the winner

# Features
1. Team Selection: Input the names of Team A and Team B that are playing against each other.
2. Current Score: Input what is the current runs made by team and current over and current wickets fallen and runs and wickets in the last 5 overs.
3. Predict Score: App will predict the score after 5 overs

# Prerequisites
Install Python on your computer or Download Python from [Python Link](https://www.python.org/)

# Dataset
The dataset plays a pivotal role in the project's functionality, encompassing 76,000 rows and 15 columns. Access the dataset here: [DataSet Link](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/blob/main/Data%20Set/ipl_data.csv)

# Requirement Engineering 
For every project, whether building a Python project or making a pizza, there are some requirements. For example, in my project, there are the main requirements mentioned below.
1. Data: As we already have our data in CSV File and it contains historical IPL matches from 2008 to 2017.
2. Tools and Resources: We need Python Programming Language,Libraries such as
   * Pandas
   * Numpy
   * Matplotlib / Seaborn
3. Domain Knowledge: Familiarity with the Indian Premier League (IPL), its teams, players, and rules of the game.Understanding of factors that influence match outcomes.
   Knowledge of cricket analytics and how it is applied to predict match outcomes. Understanding of machine learning concepts,
   including regression, classification, and feature engineering.

4. Evaluation Metrics:
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * Mean Percentage Error (MPE)

# UML
For someone who is not familiar with coding,he or she can't understand how this project is working so for that we have UML which stands for Unified Modeling Language 
which describes the flow of project or how the project is working with the help of Flow Charts for example Class A then after excuting Class A it will go to Class B.
Since I have done only 50% of my code so till the part I have finished my code here the UML for this and the link is given below [UML Diagram]

# Prerequisites
Install Python on your computer or Download Python from [Python Link](https://www.python.org/)
Download Anacondas to acess jupyter notebook to write code in python here is the link [Anacondas](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or 
We can use Google Colab Notebooks [colab](https://colab.google/)

# Code File: 
To access the code and check how I created this project the link is given Below
[IPL Score Predictor Link](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/blob/main/Python%20File/IPL_Score_Prediction%20(2).ipynb)

# Dataset
The dataset plays a pivotal role in the project's functionality, encompassing 76,000 rows and 15 columns. Access the dataset here: [DataSet Link](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/blob/main/Data%20Set/ipl_data.csv)

# Requirement Engineering 
The process of gathering, documenting, and managing the requirements and expectations of stakeholders for a system or product is known as requirements engineering. The objective is to obviously characterize what the framework or item ought to do, guaranteeing that engineers get it and can meet those prerequisites.

# UML
For someone who is not familiar with coding,he or she can't understand how this project is working so for that we have UML which stands for Unified Modeling Language 
which describes the flow of project or how the project is working with the help of Flow Charts for example Class A then after excuting Class A it will go to Class B.
Since I have done only 50% of my code so till the part I have finished my code here the UML for this is here

# DDD
DDD (Domain Driven Design) is very  similar to hosting a party or event. When understanding what you need for your domain, you can use real-world scenarios to help you understand. For example, I plan a party for my friends and think about what they need for the party: food, drinks, music, games, etc. Just like with software, you need to understand what you need from it 
features, libraries, etc. These are my domains which are the most important parts of the software or party. These are the requirements of the party or  the software and ultimately the requirements or needs 
we make plans. B. What food and drinks should be served at the party? Similarly, DDD creates a plan  for each piece of software, and groups may change the plan depending on the guest. Similarly, DDD changes the software plan  based on what the user needs and uses DDD's changes and adjustments to ensure that the software is useful and works well for the user.

### Analysis 
The analysis phase in software engineering involves understanding and examining a problem or a set of requirements before designing and building a solution. It's like investigating and planning before you start constructing a building.

## Clean Code Development

Clean Code Development refers to writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Delivering code that is correct, productive, efficient, and adheres to best practices is the goal. Clean code is easy for everyone to follow and understand; it's like an effective and unquestionable recipe. 

Here is my PDF that states why my code is clean 

[Clean Code Development.pdf](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/blob/main/Clean%20Code%20Development/Clean%20Code%20Development%20(4).pdf)


## Testing and Test Units

In computer programming, testing is a pivotal cycle to guarantee that a product application functions true to form and meets its necessities. It includes executing the product and noticing its way of behaving to track down any imperfections or issues. 

Here is my Test File [Testing File](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/blob/main/Testing/test_units%20(1).py) 

![Test Cases Run](https://github.com/KhushalKhare/software_development/assets/148461152/3d4b2c30-7301-4c58-b2b9-40d5032c4cb3)

## Build Management 

In software development, the process of assembling and compiling source code into an executable or deployable form is known as build management. It entails activities including managing dependencies, assembling source code, and producing the finished product that may be tested or given to customers. 

For my project, I used PyBuilder tool to check my build and build is sucessful here is the screenshot attached

## Functional Programming 

Writing computer programs in the functional programming style avoids using mutable and changing-state data, instead treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. To put it another way, it's style of designing code where the emphasis is on articulating the desired outcome rather than the specifics of how to get there.

Here is the code file that has demonstrated functional programming concept

## Usage 

## IPL Score Prediction
Delve into the core of our application through the IPL Score Card Prediction Personality Quiz. Users embark on a curated journey of scenario-based questions, offering responses that serve as the building blocks for unveiling their distinctive personality profile. Get ready to uncover the intricate layers of your cricket intuition as you predict IPL scorecards with a touch of personalized flair.

## Web App Implementation
Crafting Experiences with Flask and HTML

Our web application comes to life with the dynamic duo of Python's Flask framework and HTML. Flask provides a robust foundation for web development, while HTML shapes the user interface, creating an immersive and intuitive experience.

## IDE and ShortCut

IDE : Choosing an IDE depends on personal preference and the programming language So for me as Python user it was either of these Pycharm, VSCode, Google Colab.

Shortcuts : The best shortcuts depend on what you need and want to do, but here are some of the ones I use all the time and are easy to remember.

PyCharm:

Key Shortcuts:

Ctrl + Space: Auto-complete code.

Ctrl + Alt + L (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Alt + L (Mac): Reformat code.

Ctrl + Shift + A (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + A (Mac): Find actions and commands.

Ctrl + E (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + E (Mac): Recent files.

Ctrl + Shift + F10 (Windows/Linux) or Shift + Cmd + F10 (Mac): Run the script.

VSCode:

Key Shortcuts:

Ctrl + Space: Auto-complete code.

Alt + Shift + F: Reformat code.

Ctrl + P: Quick file navigation.

Ctrl + `: Open the integrated terminal.

F5: Run the script.

## Conclusion

Unleash the thrill of IPL Score Card Prediction, where personalized insights meet cricket anticipation for an unparalleled gaming experience.
